RAM is a primary storage memory which is volatile.
Secondary memory is non volatile.
RAM's are Dynamic Random Access Memory(DRAM) and Static Random Access Memory (SRAM).
Static RAM (SRaM) is faster than Dynamic RAM (DRAM).
Dynamic RAM (DRAM) are made up of transistor and capacitor.
Static RAM (SRAM) is made up of several transistors that form a latch.
GPIO (General purpose Input/Output)is a peripheral that allows communication with the outside environment.
The system bus is the median that connects peripherals to the processor.It has eight buses.
CPU(Central processing Unit) contain ALU(Arithmetic Logic Unit).
CPU performs ALU operations that is Arithmetic operations and logic operation .
The clock speed is 180 MHZ.
Cortex M is a microprocessor that contains only the processor.
ARM Cortex M4 it cotains an I-Bus,D-Bus and S-Bus.
I-Bus -Instrection Bus.
D-Bus -Data Bus.
S-Bus -System Bus.
Peripherals are sending by using "SYSTEM BUS"(S-Bus).
GPIO's it has GPIO PIN and GPIO PORT.
Many GPIO PIN join together is called Port.
